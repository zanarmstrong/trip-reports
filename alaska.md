# Alaska - August 2016

### Why this trip?
Exploring one of the most amazing states in US. Big outdoors & nature. Backpacking in Denali. Seeing wildlife. Getting to road trip a bit. 

### Recommendations

#### Highly Recommended
Backcountry backpacking in Denali - 

Watching grizzley bears in K - 

Exit Glacier trail overlooking the ice field - 

Great Harvest Bread Company, in Anchorage - best bread ever. Hearty and tasty. Plus, huge free samples. 

Blueberry trail - If it's blueberry season, this trail is amazing for both the blueberries and the view. If it's not blueberry season, it's still a nice view at the end of the trail but the trail itself will be less fun. We saw more blueberries than we ever have in our lives, or ever imagined could exist in one place. We easily picked two liters, half of which we ate immediately, in a 2m section of the trail. Now I finally understand how bears could live off of blueberries. 

#### Recommended
AirBnB in Homer - 

Salmon fishing - 

Portage Glacier trail in Whittier - 

[Flying Squirrel Cafe] - This might not be worth the detour, but if you find yourself near the side road to Talkeetna and are hungry definitely go for it. Very tasty pizza. 

#### Alright
Whitewater rafting near Denali - the river was quite tame. It was as much floating down the river as whitewater, and the whitewater was pretty chill. Don't expect any actual challenge, but it was still a fun way to see the river. 

#### Not great
Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center, near Portage - this was basically a zoo for Alaskan animals.

#### Avoid
Talkeetna - very touristy town on side road on the way from Anchorage to Denali. It's definitely not worth the extra miles. The only reason to go in this direction is the yummy bakery/pizza place [Flying Squirrel Cafe], halfway up the side road.  

### Didn't do, but wish we did
[Gates of the Arctic] - this national park requires being dropped off in a bush plane, so requires some extra planning. It sounds like an amazing experience and opportunity to go very backcountry, and very off-trail. 

[Kayaking trip from Seward] - We tried to do this, but got "sunnied out". Turns out that when it's sunny it means that the wind has blown the clouds away, and that the wind is building up waves in the bay. It looks beautiful, and is worth trying. But beware that you might not be able to do it.
