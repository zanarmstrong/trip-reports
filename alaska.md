# Alaska - August 2016

### Why this trip?
Exploring one of the most amazing states in US. Big outdoors & nature. Backpacking in Denali. Seeing wildlife. Getting to road trip a bit. 

### Recommendations

#### Highly Recommended
Backcountry, off-trail backpacking in Denali - This was Jonas' favorite thing we did in 2016, besides our own wedding. 

[Grizzly bears in Katmai, flight plane from Homer](http://www.emeraldairservice.com/) - from Homer, you can take a small plane over to Katmai National Park where they have the world's highest concetration of grizzly bears. It's amazing to watch the bears in their natural habitat. [Here](http://www.thepicturemaninc.com/blog/2016/9/4/a-day-with-the-bears) are photos and a report from another client on our trip. 

[Harding Ice Field trail](https://www.nps.gov/kefj/planyourvisit/harding_icefield_trail.htm) - Hiking 1000m up over the course of just 4 miles yields stunning views overlooking the Harding Ice Field. You can do it as a dayhike, or camping (we did camping). 

Great Harvest Bread Company, in Anchorage - best bread ever. Hearty and tasty. Plus, huge free samples. 

[Blueberry trail (Wolf Point Trail)](http://www.bluesberryinn.com/index.php/trail-maps) - If it's blueberry season, this trail is amazing for both the blueberries and the view. If it's not blueberry season, it's still a nice view at the end of the trail but the trail itself will be less fun. We saw more blueberries than we ever have in our lives, or ever imagined could exist in one place. We easily picked two liters, half of which we ate immediately, in a 2m section of the trail. Now I finally understand how bears could live off of blueberries. 

#### Recommended
Portage Glacier trail in Whittier - 

[Flying Squirrel Cafe] - This might not be worth the detour, but if you find yourself near the side road to Talkeetna and are hungry definitely go for it. Very tasty pizza. 

[Byers Lake Campground] in Denali STATE park - nice campground near a beautiful lake in Denali State park (south of the national park). Wonderful swimming, though be prepared for cold water of course :)

Alaska State Fair -

[Salmon Viewing platform](http://www.alaska.org/detail/williwaw-fish-viewing-platform#photos) & trail - on Portage Glacier road, on the way towards Whittier, there is a salmon viewing platform where you can watch salmon spawing. There is also a trail that starts here, goes under the highway, and follows the stream. Both of these were surprisingly fantastic, and we very much enjoyed watching salmon in the river. We even saw a few swim up waterfalls!

[Fresh fish from Auction Block](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-auction-block-co-homer) - Great place to buy whole fresh fish. Since you are buying a whole fish, it's easy to end up with lots of leftovers!

[Small Primrose campground](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/chugach/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=6644&actid=29) and [trail](http://www.alaska.org/detail/lost-lake-trail) on Kenai Peninsula - If you are headed to Seward, Primrose campground is a lovely, primative campground not far from Seward. It's just got 8 campsites along a river, near a lake. It's also the trailhead for a very nice trail that can be done as an out & back, or a longer one-way hike if you can catch a ride back. 

[Chinooks Restaurant in Seward](http://www.chinooksbar.com/) - great flight of bear including the apple beer, tasty entrees. Go for the main meals, rather than the sushi. 

[Cottonwood View cabin in Homer](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5591978?guests=2&adults=2&children=0&infants=0&s=SETZ-_G4) - wonderful cabin near Homer. Bonus was seeing a moose, but I'm pretty sure that's not guarenteed. 

[Two Sister's Bakery](http://twosistersbakery.net/) in Homer, AK - yum, yum, yum!

Salmon fishing -  

#### Alright
[Whitewater rafting near Denali](http://www.raftdenali.com/) - the river was quite tame. It was as much floating down the river as whitewater, and the whitewater was pretty chill. Don't expect any actual challenge, but it was still a fun way to see the river. We've heard there are other rafting spots in Alaska. 

[Downhill Mountain biking at Alyeska resort](http://www.alyeskaresort.com/mountain/downhill-mountain-biking) - We had a good time here, especially on the lower trails. However the upper beginner trails were pretty bad, and there was really only one option for most of the mountain. Possibly the upper non-beginner trails are great, but we weren't good enough at the time to ride them. 

#### Not great
Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center, near Portage - this was basically a zoo for Alaskan animals.

#### Avoid
Talkeetna - very touristy town on side road on the way from Anchorage to Denali. It's definitely not worth the extra miles. The only reason to go in this direction is the yummy bakery/pizza place [Flying Squirrel Cafe], halfway up the side road.  

### Didn't do, but wish we did
[Gates of the Arctic] - this national park requires being dropped off in a bush plane, so requires some extra planning. It sounds like an amazing experience and opportunity to go very backcountry, and very off-trail. 

[Kayaking trip from Seward] - We tried to do this with [Adventure 60 North](http://www.adventure60.com/), but got "sunnied out". Turns out that when it's sunny it means that the wind has blown the clouds away, and that the wind is building up waves in the bay. It looks beautiful, and is worth trying. But beware that you might not be able to do it. Another company a friend had recommended was [Sunny Cove](http://www.sunnycove.com/).

### Who & how?


### Need to plan early? 
Since the tourist season is so short, many things book up early. These include campgrounds in Denali National Park (not the backcountry, as you can't reserve those early), flights to see the bears in Katmai, kayaking trips, and more. We were able to get reservations for most of the things we wanted, but sometimes had to plan our trip around when certain activities were available. Other things, like rental cars, can get very expensive at the last minute. 

That said, you can't actually make Denali backpacking reservations in advance. If you want to go backpacking in the park, you show up at most one day ahead of time at the backcountry office and reserve the sections where you will hike. They've divided up the entire park into sections, and only 2-10 people can camp in each section each night depending on the section's limits. 

### Tips
T-mobile has no service in Alaska, even in Anchorage. 

Lots of places aren't accessible by roads, so you'd need to book a boat or bush plane.
