# Alaska - August 2016

### Why this trip?
Exploring one of the most amazing states in US. Big outdoors & nature. Backpacking in Denali. Seeing wildlife. Getting to road trip a bit. 

### Recommendations

#### Highly Recommended
Backcountry, off-trail backpacking in Denali - This was Jonas' favorite thing we did in 2016, besides our own wedding. 

Watching grizzley bears in Katmai - 

Exit Glacier trail overlooking the ice field - 

Great Harvest Bread Company, in Anchorage - best bread ever. Hearty and tasty. Plus, huge free samples. 

[Blueberry trail (Wolf Point Trail)](http://www.bluesberryinn.com/index.php/trail-maps) - If it's blueberry season, this trail is amazing for both the blueberries and the view. If it's not blueberry season, it's still a nice view at the end of the trail but the trail itself will be less fun. We saw more blueberries than we ever have in our lives, or ever imagined could exist in one place. We easily picked two liters, half of which we ate immediately, in a 2m section of the trail. Now I finally understand how bears could live off of blueberries. 

#### Recommended
AirBnB in Homer - 

Salmon fishing - 

Portage Glacier trail in Whittier - 

[Flying Squirrel Cafe] - This might not be worth the detour, but if you find yourself near the side road to Talkeetna and are hungry definitely go for it. Very tasty pizza. 

[Byers Lake Campground] in Denali STATE park - nice campground near a beautiful lake in Denali State park (south of the national park). Wonderful swimming, though be prepared for cold water of course :)

#### Alright
Whitewater rafting near Denali - the river was quite tame. It was as much floating down the river as whitewater, and the whitewater was pretty chill. Don't expect any actual challenge, but it was still a fun way to see the river. 

#### Not great
Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center, near Portage - this was basically a zoo for Alaskan animals.

#### Avoid
Talkeetna - very touristy town on side road on the way from Anchorage to Denali. It's definitely not worth the extra miles. The only reason to go in this direction is the yummy bakery/pizza place [Flying Squirrel Cafe], halfway up the side road.  

### Didn't do, but wish we did
[Gates of the Arctic] - this national park requires being dropped off in a bush plane, so requires some extra planning. It sounds like an amazing experience and opportunity to go very backcountry, and very off-trail. 

[Kayaking trip from Seward] - We tried to do this, but got "sunnied out". Turns out that when it's sunny it means that the wind has blown the clouds away, and that the wind is building up waves in the bay. It looks beautiful, and is worth trying. But beware that you might not be able to do it. 

### Itinerary
Aug 11: arrive in Anchorage

### Who & how?


### Need to plan early? 
Since the tourist season is so short, many things book up early. These include campgrounds in Denali National Park (not the backcountry, as you can't reserve those early), flights to see the bears in Katmai, kayaking trips, and more. We were able to get reservations for most of the things we wanted, but sometimes had to plan our trip around when certain activities were available. Other things, like rental cars, can get very expensive at the last minute. 

That said, you can't actually make Denali backpacking reservations in advance. If you want to go backpacking in the park, you show up at most one day ahead of time at the backcountry office and reserve the sections where you will hike. They've divided up the entire park into sections, and only 2-10 people can camp in each section each night depending on the section's limits. 

### Tips
T-mobile has no service in Alaska, even in Anchorage. 

Lots of places aren't accessible by roads, so you'd need to book a boat or bush plane.
